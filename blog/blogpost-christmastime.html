            <p>
                Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo!" (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
                Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
